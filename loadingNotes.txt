Game -> Highest level game object

inject clock and scenes

scenes may be added via constructor in a 'scene's object
*a scene called "index" must be provided and will be set to the 
game's default currentScene*


Example of instantiation may be:

App.game = new Kane.Game({
  scenes: {
    'index': index //this is a required default and will trigger a throw if not provided
    'ingame': ingame //this must be previously instantiated and available
    'loading': loading //this must be previously instantiaed and available
  },
  clock: new Kane.Clock(),
});

4 Methods: start, stop, setCurrentScene, getCurrentScene

Scene -> every game is composed of these.  They can be phases of a game,
load screens, menus, etc.  They must have a name 

App.ingame = new Kane.Scene({
  name: 'ingame'
});
